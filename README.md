# Hello-World

<h1>Starting Over</h1>
<p><strong>None</strong> of this really matters.  I'm just writing
  some stuff so this isn't <strong>empty</strong> <br> and to get used to typing
  in a <em>coding type format</em> and to remember <strong>html tags</strong></P>
<h2>Trying New Stuff</h2>
<p><em>New</em> stuff is just like the <em>old</em> stuff</p>
